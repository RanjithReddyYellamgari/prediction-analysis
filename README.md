****Predicting Cirrhosis Onset with Python**

**Project Summary**

Team Name: UPMOST
Team Members: Sudhir, Ranjith, Srikar, Abbas, Shiva Ram, Neha
Analysis Description:

**Dataset:** Liver Patient data from UCI repository
Task: Binary classification for Cirrhosis diagnosis
Key Features: Age, Gender, and various chemical compounds
Emphasis: Recall as the main evaluation metric
Objective:

Build a binary classifier to identify Cirrhosis diagnosis necessity.


**Approach**:
Utilize k-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting algorithms.
Focus on maximizing recall to accurately identify positive cases.

**Key Steps:**
Data preprocessing: Clean, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
Model training and evaluation: Assess models using recall and other relevant metrics.
Model selection: Choose the model with the best recall and predictive power.
Model optimization: Fine-tune the selected model for improved performance.
Model deployment: Deploy the optimized model for real-world predictions.
Ensure adherence to data science best practices, and seek support from relevant resources if needed.
